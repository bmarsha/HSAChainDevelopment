Abstract People use various channels to spend and manage their health savings account currency. Electronic based health savings accounts promote units of movement that require a network-wide consensus unique to that service. This leads to inevitable need for health savings accounts to utilize a blockchain ledger.

Introduction In its purest form HSA Chain is an entity that has modular interfaces allowing simple application development delivered to an end user, blockchain ledger for today’s security and accountability, and unlimited scalability with power and efficiency all coming together for forward thinking function.

Data and Information Health savings accounts are utilized by millions of people and the organic movement forward is to harness our powerful technology of today and tomorrow. HSA Chain uses a cryptologic ledger to keep accounting honest and efficient. The advantage of utilizing blockchain technology increases the value and usability of a traditional health savings account.

HSA Chain is not a health savings account and does not represent itself as a health savings account. HSA Chain encompasses the next generation technology for health savings accounts.

Blockchain and Mining HSA Chain bases its standard off of ethereum’s blockchain and mining protocol. This is a tried and true method and system set up specifically for projects such as HSA Chain. The blockchain starts by checking the previously referenced block for validity, then checks for proof of work validity, then finishes with a final validly check as the algorithm is passed through. In the future, as quantum computing becomes mainstream, quantum proof algorithms, which are already in existence, will be activated.

Destination HSA Chain's roadmap is designed for a foundation of technology and future technologies to be implemented in a modular way as well. We started with a powerful blockchain that functions to make current technologies run efficiently and quickly. The project has full scalability for accommodating unlimited innovation for health savings account technology and services. Market needs will drive much advancement that is started in this project. HSA chain is an open source project and a great many entities will have the ability to use the project's built in outlets for modular rollouts. Developers can easily create applications based on the demand of the market using the coding language and platform of their choice. HSA Chain allows for a health savings account that is extremely cost efficient, easy to use, and available at lightning speed when you need it.

Conclusion We have proposed and created a way for health savings accounts to be integrated with blockchain technology for scaling, power, efficiency, applications, a better user experience, and for future technological advances on the way.
